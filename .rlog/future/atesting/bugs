### org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.CompilationErrorException: Compilation error. See log for more details
e: This version (1.3.2) of the Compose Compiler requires Kotlin version 1.7.20 but you appear to be using Kotlin version 1.8.20 which is not known to be compatible.  Please fix your configuration (or `suppressKotlinVersionCompatibilityCheck` but don't say I didn't warn you!).
- problem: kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion depends on kotlin version
- solution: version updated to latest : kotlin version updated to 1.8.21, kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion = "1.4.7"
